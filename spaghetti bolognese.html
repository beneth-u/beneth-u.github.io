<p>The love for my grandmotherâ€™s spaghetti bolognese is way to me than just the taste of the spaghetti itself. It embodies cherished memories and the warmth of family gatherings. Her recipe, perfected over decades, combines the freshest ingredients with a variety of spices creating a rich sauce that has become a family legend. Each bite is a nostalgic journey, reminding me of the comfort and love that only a grandmother can provide. Inspired by the joy it brings to our family, I am driven to share this culinary success with the world. By turning her beloved spaghetti bolognese into a business, I aim to honor her legacy and bring the same sense of warmth and happiness to others, one delicious plate at a time.

<p>To create a tasty spaghetti bolognese, begin by heating a generous tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add finely chopped onions and minced garlic, dry-cooking them until they become soft and translucent, releasing aromatic flavors. Next, introduce the ground beef to the pan, cooking it until it is thoroughly browned and no longer pink, breaking it up with a wooden spoon to ensure even cooking. Pour in the beef broth, allowing it to simmer and reduce by half, which will add a rich flavour to the sauce.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crumbled beef bouillon cubes, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, fresh thyme sprigs, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer gently for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. This slow simmering process allows the flavors to meld together beautifully, creating a delicious sauce.

While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until it is al dente, following the package instructions. Once cooked, drain the spaghetti in a colander and set it aside. As the sauce continues to thicken and develop its flavors, remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs before serving.

To serve, place a generous portion of the hot spaghetti on each plate and ladle the rich bolognese sauce over the top. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley, if desired.
